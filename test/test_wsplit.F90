    !
    ! WHY THIS TEST EXISTS
    ! --------------------
    ! use_wsplit splits w = w_e + w_i and advects w_i implicitly. FESOM2 (oce_ale.F90:
    ! 3217-3265) does this with a hard switch at CFL_z = wsplit_maxcfl, so d(w_e)/d(CFL)
    ! jumps from 1 to 0 there and a face oscillating around the threshold flips between
    ! high-order explicit and partly first-order implicit treatment. FESOM3 replaces the
    ! switch by the C^1 limiting function of Shchepetkin (2015, Ocean Modelling 91, 38-69,
    ! Sec. 3.1 / Fig. 9; NEMO sshwzv.F90 wAimp). There is no oracle for it: FESOM2 has only
    ! the hard switch. So this test IS the specification (L54): every property the plan
    ! claims for the function is asserted here, with the closed forms derived in the
    ! comments. Part W needs no mesh; parts S and X run on the pi mesh at np 1/2.
    !
    ! THE FUNCTION. f = wsplit_implicit_fraction(Cu, Cu_min, Cu_max) is the IMPLICIT share,
    ! w_i = f*w, w_e = w - w_i. With D = Cu_max - Cu_min, F = 4*Cu_max*D and
    ! Cu_cut = 2*Cu_max - Cu_min:
    !     Cu <= Cu_min           f = 0                                   (fully explicit)
    !     Cu_min < Cu < Cu_cut   f = x^2/(F + x^2),   x = Cu - Cu_min   (smooth bend)
    !     Cu >= Cu_cut           f = (Cu - Cu_max)/Cu                   (Cu_e == Cu_max)
    ! Closed forms used below: at Cu_cut, x = 2D, so the middle branch gives
    ! 4D^2/(4*Cu_max*D + 4D^2) = D/Cu_cut and the top branch (Cu_cut - Cu_max)/Cu_cut =
    ! D/Cu_cut (C^0). Slopes: middle 2xF/(F+x^2)^2 = 16*Cu_max*D^2/(16*D^2*Cu_cut^2) =
    ! Cu_max/Cu_cut^2, top Cu_max/Cu^2 = Cu_max/Cu_cut^2 (C^1). At Cu_min the middle branch
    ! has f = 0 and f' = 2xF/(F+x^2)^2 = 0, matching the flat lower branch (C^1). f -> 1
    ! as Cu -> inf; Cu_e = Cu*(1-f) is non-decreasing (middle branch: d/dCu proportional to
    ! F - x^2 - 2x*Cu_min >= 0 for x <= 2D) and equals Cu_max exactly on the top branch.
    !
    ! FLOATING POINT. On the top branch 1-f = Cu_max/Cu is formed by cancellation, so
    ! Cu*(1-f) carries an ABSOLUTE error ~eps*Cu (relative ~eps*Cu/Cu_max); W2 and W6
    ! account for it.
    !
    ! PART W - the function, for the parameter sets (0.5,1), (0.9,1), (0,1), (0.25,0.5):
    !   W1 f == 0 exactly for Cu in {0, Cu_min/2, Cu_min}
    !   W2 cap: |Cu*(1-f) - Cu_max| <= 1e-14*Cu for Cu in {Cu_cut, 2, 5, 50, 1e4}
    !   W3 f(1e6*Cu_max) > 1 - 2e-6; 0 <= f <= 1 on a 10^4-point grid in [0, 20]
    !   W4 C^0 joints: the two branch formulas agree AT Cu_min and AT Cu_cut to 1e-14, and
    !      the module's value at Cu_cut is the joint value. (A grid comparison of the
    !      module against the test's own copies of the branch formulas was dropped: both
    !      copies would be wrong together, so it could not fail for a wrong formula, and
    !      branch SELECTION is already pinned by W1 at Cu_min, W2 on the cap and W5.)
    !   W5 C^1 joints, h = 1e-6: at Cu_min both one-sided difference quotients have
    !      |q| <= 2h/F (closed-form slope 0: the right quotient is h/(F+h^2)); at Cu_cut
    !      both agree with Cu_max/Cu_cut^2 to 1e-5 relative
    !   W6 monotone: f non-decreasing on the grid; Cu_e non-decreasing up to the
    !      saturated-branch noise, 4*eps*Cu (see the derivation at the check)
    !   W7 vectorised == scalar bitwise: the array (elemental) call equals the scalar
    !      loop. Not a language-level check (an elemental function IS its element-wise
    !      application) but a compiler-path check: this build uses -no-prec-div
    !      -fimf-use-svml, under which the vectorised call may take a different
    !      reciprocal / SVML path than the scalar loop, and S2's bitwise w_i == f*w
    !      relies on the scalar bits
    !   W8 wsplit_check_params accepts (0,1), (0.5,1), (1,1); rejects (-0.1,1), (1.1,1),
    !      (0.5,0)
    !
    ! CAVITY COLUMNS. pi has ulevels_nod2D = 1 everywhere, so the nzmin-based index layout
    ! of compute_CFLz / compute_Wvel_split / the part-X kernels would otherwise be tested
    ! at nzmin = 1 only (an nz = 1 vs nz = nzmin slip would pass). Every 10th GLOBAL node
    ! with >= 14 levels gets ulevels_nod2D = 3 (synth_cavity; by the global index so the
    ! owner and its halo copies agree, which S5 relies on). Parts S and X run on the mix.
    !
    ! PART S - compute_Wvel_split on the pi mesh, every OWNED+HALO face (the routine
    ! produces the halo, which the next step's momentum TDMA / vector-invariant advection
    ! read at the halo vertices of owned elements). Prescribed w (nonzero at every level
    ! incl. the surface, both signs) and a cfl_z field spanning [0, 5] in steps of 0.05, so
    ! it contains faces exactly AT 0, Cu_min, Cu_max and Cu_cut; parameter sets (0.5,1),
    ! (0.9,1), (0.25,0.5):
    !   S1 |w_e + w_i - w| <= 1 ulp(w) at every face (w_e = w - w_i; the consumers need no
    !      more than that)
    !   S2 w_i == f(cfl_z)*w BITWISE: the split IS the limiting function, nothing else
    !   S3 use_wsplit=.false.: w_e == w and w_i == +0 bitwise (sign of zero included) --
    !      the production drivers' path, byte-identical to the previous off path
    !   S4 cfl_z <= Cu_min -> w_i == 0 exactly; cfl_z >= Cu_cut -> |w_e|*cfl_z/|w| ==
    !      Cu_max to 1e-14*cfl_z (the explicit Courant number is capped EXACTLY, FESOM2's
    !      meaning of wsplit_maxcfl is kept); every class non-empty
    !   S5 THE HALO CONTRACT (teeth at np >= 2; vacuous at np 1). S1-S4 prescribe w and
    !      cfl_z from the LOCAL node index, so a halo copy does not carry its owner's
    !      values and S1-S4 can only verify per-face identities. S5 prescribes w and
    !      hnode_new from the GLOBAL index (every halo copy then holds exactly its owner's
    !      inputs, as after vert_vel_ale's exchange_nod of Wvel/hnode_new), runs
    !      compute_CFLz + compute_Wvel_split, and requires cfl_z, w_e and w_i at every halo
    !      node to equal the owner's BITWISE, checked against an exchange_nod'd copy. No
    !      consumer exchanges w_e/w_i, and the conserve gate is blind to a wrong halo
    !      w_e/w_i (heat/salt/volume still telescope), so this is the only net on the
    !      contract. Positive control at np >= 2: inputs from the LOCAL index must
    !      produce mismatches.
    !
    ! PART X - transition smoothness on the NON-FCT tracer path: QR4C explicit vertical
    ! advection on w_e (adv_tra_ver_qr4c -> oce_tra_adv_flux2dtracer -> the ALE reconstruct
    ! of diff_tracers_ale) followed by the upwind TDMA on w_i (diff_ver_part_impl_ale,
    ! do_wimpl), Kv = 0, no surface fluxes, Redi off, tra_adv_lim /= 'FCT'.
    !
    ! WHY THIS PATH AND NOT THE FCT LOW-ORDER PAIR (plan review). Explicit upwind on w_e
    ! followed by implicit upwind on w_i across one face is EXACTLY split-independent: the
    ! donor cell gives T2*(h2 - dt*w_e)/(h2 - dt*w + dt*w_i) = T2 and the receiver then holds
    ! T1*h1 + dt*w*T2 whatever f, so a hard switch leaves no first-order kink there. The
    ! kink is first order only where the explicit and implicit operators differ at first
    ! order: QR4C (centred, 4th order) against the upwind TDMA. Hence this scan.
    !
    ! X0 CLOSED FORM OF THE KINK. Uniform layers h (hnode = hnode_new = h: a smoothness
    ! probe, not a conservation test), uniform interior w (faces 2..nzmax-1; the surface and
    ! bottom faces 0, so compute_CFLz gives one interior Courant number Cu = 2|w|dt/h --
    ! it counts the face flux against BOTH adjacent cells), a quadratic T(z) = T0 + bq*z +
    ! cq*z^2 sampled at the cell mid-depths. Per unit w the per-step increments at a cell p
    ! whose faces p and p+1 lie in QR4C's 4th-order range (nz in [nzmin+2, nzmax-2]) are
    !   QR4C (num_ord = 1): face value T(z_face) - cq*h^2/12 at BOTH faces (the h^2 term
    !                       cancels in the divergence), so
    !                       P_q T(p) = -dt*(T(z_p + h/2) - T(z_p - h/2))/h = -dt*T'(z_p)
    !   upwind, w > 0:      face value = the cell below -> P_u T(p) = -dt*(T'(z_p) - cq*h)
    !   upwind, w < 0:      face value = the cell above -> P_u T(p) = -dt*(T'(z_p) + cq*h)
    ! The hard switch (Cu_min = Cu_max = C, threshold velocity w_c) gives
    !   below C:  Delta = w*P_q T,                        dDelta/dw = P_q T
    !   above C:  w_e = w_c frozen, w_i = w - w_c,  Delta = (I + w_i*U)^-1 T* - T, where
    !             T* = T + w_c*P_q T is the tracer AFTER the explicit step (which has already
    !             acted when the TDMA runs) and (I + w_i*U)^-1 is the TDMA with U the upwind
    !             matrix per unit velocity; d/dw_i at w_i = 0 is -U = P_u, so
    !             dDelta/dw = P_u T* = P_u T + w_c*P_u(P_q T)
    ! P_q T is linear in z with slope -2*cq*dt, and P_u of a linear profile is -dt times
    ! its slope = 2*cq*dt^2 for either sign of w. The jump of dDelta/dw at the threshold is
    !   J_w = (P_u - P_q)T + 2*cq*dt^2*w_c = sgn(w)*cq*dt*h*(1 + Cu_c),   Cu_c = 2|w_c|dt/h
    ! and in units of the scan variable Cu (dw/dCu = sgn(w)*h/(2dt))
    !   J = cq*h^2*(1 + Cu_c)/2                              (both signs of w)
    ! The plan's shorthand J = [UPW - QR4C](T) is the Cu_c -> 0 limit cq*h^2/2; the factor
    ! (1 + Cu_c) is the pre-advection of T to T* at the threshold and X2 pins it to 5 %.
    ! A function with a derivative jump J has the second difference J*dCu at a grid point
    ! ON the kink (the scan puts Cu = Cu_max exactly on a grid point; the explicit branch
    ! is exactly linear in Cu, the implicit branch adds O(dCu/(1+Cu_c)) curvature) and
    ! J*dCu split over two neighbours otherwise -- hence the plan's >= 0.5*|J|*dCu floor.
    ! bq is chosen so that T'(z_p) = 4*cq*h at the probe: the kink then exceeds the X1
    ! bound by 13-20x for the hard switch while the smooth function stays ~4x below it.
    !
    ! COLUMNS. The chain is column-local and T, h and w depend on the level index relative
    ! to the column's own surface only, so every column of equal (ulevels, nlevels) is
    ! identical by construction. Part X therefore probes ONE representative owned column
    ! per (ulevels, nlevels) class and shrinks every other local column to 2 layers for
    ! the scan (setup_x): the kernels loop over all owned columns regardless, and this is
    ! what keeps the 2404 full-chain evaluations at seconds instead of a minute. The max
    ! over the representatives IS the max over all columns. Cavity columns are their own
    ! classes: depths and T are built relative to each column's surface and the probe is
    ! cell nzmin + 4 (= 5 without cavity), so an nz = 1 vs nz = nzmin slip in a kernel or
    ! the split would show up as a different Delta at a cavity probe.
    !
    !   X1 smooth (0.5,1), 601 points in [0, 3] (dCu = 0.005), probe cell nzmin + 4 of one
    !      representative owned column per (ulevels, nlevels) class with >= 10 levels (its
    !      stencil, and the T* cells the closed form needs, stay in the 4th-order range),
    !      both signs of w: the first differences D1 of Delta(Cu) are continuous, i.e. the
    !      second differences obey |D2| <= 5*dCu*max|D1| everywhere. WHY 5 (not the plan's
    !      10): a C^0-but-not-C^1 alternative such as a LINEAR ramp of f on [Cu_min,
    !      Cu_cut] has a d(Cu_i)/dCu jump of ~0.17 at Cu_min (vs 1 for the hard switch)
    !      and a smaller J there (Cu_c = 0.5): an expected ratio of ~12 (w > 0) / ~8
    !      (w < 0), i.e. it would have PASSED a bound of 10 for w < 0. 5 rejects it for
    !      both signs and is still 4x above the measured 0.96 / 1.17.
    !   X2 hard switch (1,1), the same scan: VIOLATES the X1 criterion (proves X1 has
    !      teeth), and at the kink D2 >= 0.5*|J|*dCu and |D2 - J*dCu| <= 0.05*|J|*dCu
    !      (pins J, both signs of w). X3a is not re-evaluated on this run (it would be the
    !      same f = 0 branch at 201 more points with nothing new to assert).
    !   X3 limits: (a) for Cu <= Cu_min the split chain equals the explicit QR4C chain with
    !      the full w BITWISE at every owned cell, at all 101 scan points; (b) the fully
    !      implicit limit w_e = 0, w_i = w at Cu = 2: the chain equals the closed-form
    !      recursion of the do_wimpl TDMA rows (r = |w|dt/h; donor-side
    !      (S + r*S_donor)/(1 + r), the open surface/bottom rows as diff_ver_part_impl_ale
    !      builds them) to 1e-13 relative, both signs. (A former "chain == pure TDMA
    !      bitwise" check was dropped: with w_e = 0 the QR4C flux is identically zero, so
    !      the chain IS the TDMA by construction and the check could not fail.)
