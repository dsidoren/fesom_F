# Smooth Courant-number-dependent explicit/implicit vertical advection (`use_wsplit`)

## Overview

Port FESOM2's `w_impl` option (`use_wsplit`: split `w = w_e + w_i`, advect `w_e` explicitly
and `w_i` implicitly) and replace its hard CFL switch by the smooth, C¹ limiting function of
Shchepetkin (2015, Ocean Modelling 91, 38-69, Sec. 3.1 / Fig. 9). The smooth function is the
ONLY split: there is no "FESOM2 mode" (decision 2026-10-02).

Problem solved: at high vertical Courant numbers (thin z* surface layers, cavities,
strong convection, fine vertical grids) explicit vertical advection is unstable. FESOM2 caps
the explicit Courant number at `wsplit_maxcfl` and sends the excess to an implicit upstream
solve, but `d(w_e)/d(CFL)` jumps from 1 to 0 at the threshold, so cells oscillating around it
flip between high-order explicit and partly first-order implicit treatment. The Shchepetkin
function makes the explicit share a C¹ function of the Courant number: identity below
`Cu_min`, a smooth bend, exact saturation at `Cu_max` above `Cu_cut = 2·Cu_max − Cu_min`.

Integration: the split lives where FESOM2 has it (`compute_Wvel_split` at the end of
`vert_vel_ale`); all consumers of `w_e`/`w_i` are already in place EXCEPT the FCT tracer path
(`adv_tra_vert_impl`, currently an `error stop`), which this plan ports. Nothing else in the
discretization changes.

Reviewed 2026-10-02 (plan-review agent): numerical core confirmed; test tolerances, the
smoothness test design, the `fesom_pressuredump` dependency and several coverage gaps
corrected below.

## Context (from discovery)

- `src/oce/oce_ale.F90`: `compute_CFLz` (443-483, FESOM2 :3126-3213) builds
  `CFL_z(nz,n) = |w(nz)|·dt·(1/h(nz−1) + 1/h(nz))` — the interface flux counted against BOTH
  adjacent cells (surface interface: one term). `compute_Wvel_split` (489-531, FESOM2
  :3217-3265): the hard split `dd=(CFL−C)/C`, `w_e = w/(1+dd)`, `w_i = w·dd/(1+dd)` for
  `CFL_z > wsplit_maxcfl`. Called at `vert_vel_ale` :438-439 after the `exchange_nod` of
  `Wvel`/`hnode_new`, over owned+halo nodes.
- Consumers of the split, state in FESOM3:
  - momentum TDMA `impl_vert_visc_ale`: `w_i` upwind flux form (+ advective-form correction
    for `momadv_opt==1`, commit e4d2cb6) — DONE
  - momentum advection (`momentum_adv_scalar`, `momentum_adv_vinv`): `w_e` — DONE
  - non-FCT tracers: `w_i` in the vertical-diffusion TDMA (`do_wimpl`,
    `src/oce/oce_ale_tracer.F90:538, 575-618`, f3 area rule) — DONE
  - FCT tracers: `adv_tra_vert_impl` on `fct_LO` + LO flux recomputed with the FULL `w`
    (FESOM2 `oce_adv_tra_driver.F90:282-292`, `oce_adv_tra_ver.F90:90-240`) — MISSING:
    `src/oce/oce_adv_tra_driver.F90:139-142` error-stops. The one real port.
- FESOM2 2.8.0 (fetched) is identical to 2.7.3 in all of the above (only PR #836, a cavity
  NaN clean-up, is nearby). NEMO `sshwzv.F90` `wAimp` implements the same Shchepetkin
  function (its constants 0.15/0.30 belong to NEMO's Courant definition and time stepping).
- Parameters: `t_dyn%use_wsplit`, `%wsplit_maxcfl` (`src/types/mod_dyn.F90:126-127`,
  serialized :199/:227; round trip `test/test_types.F90:125-156` checks neither today).
  Every driver pins `use_wsplit=.false.` EXCEPT `src/drivers/fesom_pressuredump.F90:513-514`
  (forces `.true.`, `maxcfl=1.0`, dumps `w_split_e/w_split_i` at :940-941 for the FESOM2
  byte-gate `tools/run_pressure_gate.sh`, and counts `cfl_z > maxcfl` at :563-575). The
  FESOM2 byte-gates are retired since bottom-at-vertices (`tools/run_conserve_pi.sh` header);
  the split fields there can no longer be byte-compared and will not be.
- Tests: `test/test_ivertvisc.F90` (momentum TDMA closed forms), `test/test_vinv.F90`
  (mesh+partition scaffold), `test/test_bottom.F90` (area/areasvol conventions).
  `add_fesom_test(<name> <np>)` in `test/CMakeLists.txt`; sources are GLOBbed.
- Mesh conventions: bottom at vertices, 1-D `area(n)`, `areasvol(n)` (`areasvol = area`,
  `mod_mesh_areas.F90:450`); `adv_tra_ver_upw1` flux `= −(w·T_up)·area(n)` at interfaces,
  0 at the bottom, unsigned `−w·T·area` at the surface; FCT LO update
  `fct_LO = (T·hnode + (F_h + F_v(nz)−F_v(nz+1))·dt/areasvol)/hnode_new`
  (`oce_adv_tra_driver.F90:128-136`).

## Development Approach

- **testing approach**: TDD (user preference, established for every no-oracle scheme here)
- complete each task fully before moving to the next
- make small, focused changes; preserve the existing discretization everywhere except the
  split function and the FCT port
- **CRITICAL: every task MUST include new/updated tests** for the code it changes; tests are
  separate checklist items and must pass before the next task
- **CRITICAL: update this plan file when scope changes during implementation**
- run `ctest` in `build_intel_dp` after each task; the conservation gate
  (`tools/run_conserve_pi.sh`) at Task 4 and at the end

## Testing Strategy

- unit tests: `test/test_wsplit.F90` (limiting function; split identity on pi; the
  transition-smoothness scan on the non-FCT path, np 1/2), `test/test_wimpl_tra.F90` (FCT
  implicit column solve + driver-level assembly, np 1/2), `test/test_types.F90` (parameter
  round trip)
- e2e: `fesom_conserve` configs with `FESOM3_WSPLIT=1` (hard conservation gate, np 1/2 in
  ctest, np 8 in the shell gate), with a measured `FESOM3_WSPLIT_MAXCFL` so the split fires
- every "no jumps"/"has teeth" claim carries a positive control that must FAIL
- no oracle exists for the smooth split (FESOM2 has the hard one only): the tests ARE the
  specification (L54)

## Progress Tracking

- mark completed items with `[x]` immediately when done
- add newly discovered tasks with ➕ prefix
- document issues/blockers with ⚠️ prefix

## Solution Overview

Three parts, in dependency order:

1. **Limiting function** (pure, elemental, its own module `oce_wsplit`):
   `f = wsplit_implicit_fraction(cfl, cmin, cmax)` = implicit share, `w_i = f·w`,
   `w_e = w − w_i`. Argument: FESOM2's `CFL_z` (unchanged definition, so `wsplit_maxcfl`
   keeps its exact meaning: explicit `CFL_z` never exceeds it). Plus
   `wsplit_check_params(cmin, cmax)` (logical) used by the drivers.
2. **Split** (`compute_Wvel_split`): one line per face instead of the `dd` branch; new
   `t_dyn%wsplit_mincfl` (type default `0.5`, i.e. `0.5·wsplit_maxcfl` at the default
   `maxcfl = 1.0`), serialized.
3. **FCT tracer port** (`adv_tra_vert_impl`): FESOM2's per-column upstream backward-Euler
   TDMA on the low-order solution with `w_i`, then the LO upwind flux recomputed with the
   full `w` so the antidiffusive flux is `HO(w) − LO(w)` as in FESOM2.

Decisions: Option A of the brainstorm (FESOM2 `CFL_z`, parameters `(wsplit_mincfl,
wsplit_maxcfl)`); no NEMO-style horizontal-Courant coupling; no FESOM2 hard-switch mode;
default `wsplit_mincfl = 0.5·wsplit_maxcfl`; `use_wsplit` stays `.false.` in production
drivers (enabling it in `job_levante` is the user's call).

## Technical Details

### Limiting function (Shchepetkin 2015, Sec. 3.1; NEMO `wAimp`)

With `Cu_cut = 2·Cu_max − Cu_min`, `D = Cu_max − Cu_min` and `F = 4·Cu_max·D`:

```
Cu <= Cu_min           : f = 0                                  (fully explicit)
Cu_min < Cu < Cu_cut   : f = (Cu−Cu_min)^2 / ( F + (Cu−Cu_min)^2 )
Cu >= Cu_cut           : f = (Cu − Cu_max) / Cu                 (explicit part capped)
```

Verified properties (review): at `Cu_cut` the middle branch gives `f = D/Cu_cut`, the upper
branch `(Cu_cut−Cu_max)/Cu_cut = D/Cu_cut`; slopes `2xF/(F+x²)² = Cu_max/Cu_cut²` and
`Cu_max/Cu²` agree; at `Cu_min` `f = f' = 0`. `Cu_e = Cu·(1−f)` is non-decreasing
(`d/dCu ∝ F − x² − 2x·Cu_min ≥ 0` on the middle branch). `f → 1` as `Cu → ∞`. The
degenerate `Cu_min = Cu_max` (`F = 0`) is FESOM2's hard switch in exact arithmetic — used
only as the positive control of the smoothness test, never as a mode.

Floating point: above `Cu_cut`, `1−f = Cu_max/Cu` is formed by cancellation, so
`Cu·(1−f)` carries a relative error `~eps·Cu/Cu_max`; tolerances below account for it.

Parameter validation: `wsplit_check_params(cmin, cmax) = (cmax > 0 .and. cmin >= 0 .and.
cmin <= cmax)`; the drivers `error stop` on `.false.`.

### `compute_Wvel_split`

```
if (.not. use_wsplit) then  Wvel_e = Wvel; Wvel_i = 0          ! literally today's off path
else
  do node = 1, nNodL;  do nz = ulevels_nod2D(node), nlevels_nod2D(node)
      f = wsplit_implicit_fraction(CFL_z(nz,node), mincfl, maxcfl)
      Wvel_i(nz,node) = f*Wvel(nz,node)
      Wvel_e(nz,node) = Wvel(nz,node) - Wvel_i(nz,node)
```
`w_e = w − w_i` makes `w_e + w_i` equal `w` to within 1 ulp (bitwise only when
`|w_i| ≥ |w|/2`, Sterbenz); the consumers need no more than that.

What the cap bounds: `CFL_z ≤ Cu_max` caps the FACE Courant number counted against both
cells; a cell with outflow through both faces can still have an explicit outflow fraction
up to `~2·Cu_max·h_min/h` on non-uniform layers. That is FESOM2's property too, and it is
why the boundedness test (C4) uses a uniform-`w` column (one inflow + one outflow face per
cell).

### `adv_tra_vert_impl(dt, w, ttf, mesh, partit)` (port of FESOM2 :90-240)

Per owned column, `zinv = dt`, `v = zinv·area(n)/areasvol(n)` (f3: 1-D; `= dt` exactly
since `areasvol = area`, kept in the FESOM2 form for readability):
```
surface  a=0;  b = hnode_new + w(nz)·v − min(0,w(nz+1))·v;  c = −max(0,w(nz+1))·v
interior a = min(0,w(nz))·v;  b = hnode_new + max(0,w(nz))·v − min(0,w(nz+1))·v;  c = −max(0,w(nz+1))·v
bottom   a = min(0,w(nz))·v;  b = hnode_new + max(0,w(nz))·v;  c = 0
rhs      tr = −a·T(nz−1) − (b − hnode_new)·T(nz) − c·T(nz+1);  solve;  T += tr
```
Column sums of the matrix equal `hnode_new` (conservative); strictly diagonally dominant
with non-positive off-diagonals (TDMA stable). The unsigned surface term matches the
explicit surface flux `−w·T·area` of `adv_tra_ver_upw1` (L57 form consistency). FESOM2
computes `zbar_n/Z_n` here but never uses them — dropped. Columns with fewer than 2 layers
are not supported by the row layout (same trap as `adv_tra_ver_upw1`, documented there):
guard with `error stop` (pi minimum is 4 layers). The driver branch becomes FESOM2's:
`call adv_tra_vert_impl(dt, wi, fct_LO, mesh, partit)` then
`call adv_tra_ver_upw1(w, ttf, mesh, adv_flux_ver, o_init_zero=.true., partit=partit)`
with the FULL `w` (`pwvel => w` for FCT is already in place). Local `a,b,c,tr,cp,tp` are
per column (private if OpenMP is ever added).

### Why constants are preserved (the free-stream test)

`hnode_new` is advanced with the full `w`. For uniform `T`, the explicit LO step with `w_e`
gives `T* = T·(1 + dt·δw_i·area/(areasvol·hnode_new))`; the implicit step solves
`(hnode_new + dt·δw_i·area/areasvol)·T^{n+1} = hnode_new·T*`, i.e. `T^{n+1} = T` in exact
arithmetic, for ANY split with `w_e + w_i = w`. This pins the split identity, the
flux-form coefficients and the `hnode_new` usage.

### Why the smoothness test must NOT use the FCT low-order pair (review finding)

Explicit upwind with `w_e` followed by implicit upwind with `w_i` across a single face is
exactly split-independent: the donor cell gives `T₂·(h₂−dt·w_e)/(h₂−dt·w+dt·w_i) = T₂`,
and the receiver then holds `T₁h₁ + dt·w·T₂` whatever `f`. The pair differs from the
unsplit upwind step only at `O(dt²·L_i·L·T)`, which needs curvature in `T` or in `w`. The
kink of the hard switch is FIRST order only where explicit and implicit operators differ
at first order — the non-FCT path: QR4C (centred) on `w_e` plus the upwind TDMA on `w_i`.
There the tendency's derivative with respect to `w` jumps by `[UPW − QR4C](T)` at the
threshold, which is non-zero for a `T` with curvature (for linear `T` and uniform `w` the
two flux divergences coincide). Hence part X below runs on QR4C + `diff_ver_part_impl_ale`
with `Kv = 0`, quadratic `T`, uniform interior `w`, and derives the jump in closed form.

### Diagnostics

`fesom_conserve`: at the last step the number of faces with `f > 0`, with `f ≥ 0.5`, and
`max f` over owned nodes (MPI-summed/maxed), printed; with `FESOM3_WSPLIT_EXPECT_SPLIT=1`
an `error stop` if no face split (so the gate config cannot be vacuous). The production
driver prints the parameters in its banner. `fesom_pressuredump`: its `cfl_z > maxcfl`
count becomes a count of `w_i ≠ 0`; `w_split_e/w_split_i` stay in the dump as
diagnostics but are dropped from `tools/pressure_diff.py`'s compared fields (the byte-gate
is retired; the hard split no longer exists to compare against).

## What Goes Where

- **Implementation Steps**: code, tests, docs in this repo
- **Post-Completion**: enabling `use_wsplit` in `job_levante`, choosing `wsplit_mincfl`,
  long-run evaluation

## Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Limiting function `wsplit_implicit_fraction` + `wsplit_check_params` (TDD)

**Files:**
- Create: `src/oce/oce_wsplit.F90` (module `oce_wsplit`)
- Create: `test/test_wsplit.F90` (part W, no mesh)
- Modify: `test/CMakeLists.txt` (`add_fesom_test(test_wsplit 1)`, `... 2`)

- [x] write part W (parameters `(0.5,1.0)`, `(0.9,1.0)`, `(0.0,1.0)`, `(0.25,0.5)`):
  - W1 `f == 0` exactly for `Cu ∈ {0, Cu_min/2, Cu_min}`
  - W2 cap: `|Cu·(1−f) − Cu_max| ≤ 1e-14·Cu` for `Cu ∈ {Cu_cut, 2, 5, 50, 1e4}`
  - W3 limits/range: `f(1e6·Cu_max) > 1 − 2e-6`; `0 ≤ f ≤ 1` on a 10⁴-point grid in `[0, 20]`
  - W4 C⁰ joints: both branch formulas evaluated AT `Cu_min` and AT `Cu_cut` agree to
    1e-14 (the function itself is continuous iff its branches agree there)
  - W5 C¹ joints, `h = 1e-6`: at `Cu_min` both one-sided difference quotients have
    `|q| ≤ 2h/F` (closed-form slope 0); at `Cu_cut` both agree with `Cu_max/Cu_cut²` to
    1e-5 relative
  - W6 monotone: `f` non-decreasing on the grid; `Cu_e` non-decreasing up to the
    saturated-branch noise `4·eps·Cu` (⚠️ was "4 ulp of `Cu_max`", which drops the
    `Cu/Cu_max` factor of the error estimate above: measured max decrease 3.9e-15 at
    `Cu ≈ 17.5` for every parameter set = 17.5 ulp(1.0) / 35.5 ulp(0.5) = 1.23 eps·Cu)
  - W7 elemental: array call equals the element-wise loop bitwise
  - W8 `wsplit_check_params`: accepts `(0,1)`, `(0.5,1)`, `(1,1)`; rejects `(−0.1,1)`,
    `(1.1,1)`, `(0.5,0)`
- [x] implement the module (three branches; `wsplit_check_params`)
- [x] run `test_wsplit` — must pass before Task 2 (np 1/2 OK; full ctest 36/36)

### Task 2: `compute_Wvel_split`, `wsplit_mincfl`, pressuredump, and the smoothness scan

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/oce/oce_ale.F90` (`compute_Wvel_split` + its header comment :489-496)
- Modify: `src/types/mod_dyn.F90` (`wsplit_mincfl = 0.5_WP`, write/read lines :199/:227)
- Modify: `test/test_types.F90` (`test_dyn` :125-156: non-default `use_wsplit`,
  `wsplit_mincfl`, `wsplit_maxcfl` round-tripped)
- Modify: `src/drivers/fesom_pressuredump.F90` (:498-501, :513-514 comments; :563-575
  diagnostic counts `w_i /= 0`), `tools/pressure_diff.py` (drop `w_split_e/w_split_i`
  from the compared fields; comment why)
- Modify: `test/test_wsplit.F90` (parts S and X, pi mesh at np 1/2 like `test_vinv`)

- [ ] write part S: prescribe `w` (nonzero at every level incl. surface, both signs) and a
  `cfl_z` field spanning `[0, 5]`; call `compute_Wvel_split`:
  - S1 `|w_e + w_i − w| ≤ 1 ulp(w)` at every owned+halo face
  - S2 `w_i(nz,n) == f(cfl_z(nz,n))·w(nz,n)` bitwise
  - S3 `use_wsplit=.false.` → `w_e == w`, `w_i == 0` bitwise (incl. sign of zero)
  - S4 faces with `cfl_z ≤ mincfl` have `w_i == 0`; faces with `cfl_z ≥ 2·maxcfl−mincfl`
    have `|w_e|·cfl_z/|w| == maxcfl` to 1e-14·cfl_z
- [ ] write part X (transition smoothness, non-FCT path; needs a minimal tracer set-up
  with `tra_adv_lim /= 'FCT'`, `Kv = 0`, no surface fluxes, Redi off):
  - X0 derive in the test header the closed-form derivative jump of the hard switch at the
    threshold for a quadratic `T` on uniform layers with uniform interior `w`:
    `J = [UPW − QR4C](T)` at the probe cell
  - X1 scan `Cu` on ≥ 600 points in `[0, 3·maxcfl]` (vary `|w|`, keep `cfl_z` consistent
    with `compute_CFLz`); per point: split → `adv_tra_ver_qr4c(w_e)` →
    `oce_tra_adv_flux2dtracer` → `diff_ver_part_impl_ale` (`do_wimpl` with `w_i`); record
    the tendency at the probe cell; assert the first differences are continuous and the
    second differences are `≤ 10·ΔCu·max|first difference|` everywhere
  - X2 positive control: the same scan with the degenerate `(mincfl = maxcfl)` function
    must violate the X1 criterion at `Cu = maxcfl` with a second difference `≥ 0.5·|J|·ΔCu`
    (proves X1 has teeth and pins `J`)
  - X3 fully explicit limit: for `Cu ≤ mincfl` the tendency equals the explicit QR4C
    tendency with the full `w` bitwise; fully implicit limit: `w_e = 0` gives the pure
    `do_wimpl` TDMA result
- [ ] rewrite `compute_Wvel_split` (table in Technical Details); update its header
- [ ] add `wsplit_mincfl` to `t_dyn` + serialization; extend `test_types` `test_dyn`;
  drivers rely on the type default (only the env-hook drivers set it, Task 4)
- [ ] `fesom_pressuredump`: comments, `w_i /= 0` count, `pressure_diff.py` field list
- [ ] run `test_wsplit` np 1/2, `test_types`, full `ctest` — must pass before Task 3

### Task 3: Port `adv_tra_vert_impl` (FCT path) + driver-level assembly test

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/oce/oce_adv_tra_ver.F90` (new public `adv_tra_vert_impl` + the 2-layer guard)
- Modify: `src/oce/oce_adv_tra_driver.F90` (:139-142 error stop → FESOM2 sequence; header
  :26-28)
- Create: `test/test_wimpl_tra.F90`
- Modify: `test/CMakeLists.txt`

- [ ] write `test_wimpl_tra` (pi mesh, np 1/2; `hnode` prescribed, `area/areasvol` from
  `compute_geometry`; `hnode_new = hnode − dt·(w(nz)−w(nz+1))·area/areasvol` for a pure
  column; the LO update formula of the driver is replicated and documented as such):
  - C1 identity: `w_i == 0` → `ttf` unchanged bitwise
  - C2 constancy: uniform `T`, divergent `w` with `w = 0` at surface and bottom,
    splits `(0.5,1.0)`, `(0.0,1.0)`, `(0.9,1.0)`: explicit LO (`adv_tra_ver_upw1(w_e)`) +
    implicit (`w_i`) → `max|T^{n+1} − T| < 1e-13·|T|`
  - C2b constancy with `w(surface) ≠ 0` of both signs (`hnode_new` consistent): same bound
    (the only unsigned row)
  - C3 conservation: non-uniform `T`, `w = 0` at surface/bottom:
    `Σ hnode_new·T^{n+1}·areasvol == Σ hnode·T·areasvol` to 1e-13 relative
  - C3b with `w(surface) ≠ 0`: content changes by exactly `−dt·w(1)·T_top·area` (1e-13)
  - C4 large Courant, uniform-`w` column (one inflow + one outflow face per cell),
    `CFL_z ≈ 10`: `T^{n+1}` within `[min T, max T]`, finite (precondition asserted:
    per-cell explicit outflow `≤ hnode`)
  - C5 fully implicit limit: `w_e = 0, w_i = w`, two-cell closed form in flux form with the
    `hnode_new` mass: error < 1e-12
  - C6 driver-level assembly: call `do_oce_adv_tra` (FCT, QR4C vertical) with
    `use_wsplit` on, a linear `T(z)` in a column with uniform interior `w` so the limiter is
    inactive (assert `fct_plus/minus` leave the antidiffusive flux unlimited), and compare
    with the test's own assembly of the correct sequence from the public parts
    (`adv_tra_ver_upw1(w_e)` → `adv_tra_vert_impl(w_i)` → `HO(w) − LO(w)` →
    `oce_tra_adv_flux2dtracer(use_lo)`); positive control: the WRONG assembly
    `HO(w) − LO(w_e)` must differ from the driver's result by more than the tolerance
    (that is the wiring bug a conservation gate cannot see: it double-counts the `w_i`
    transport yet still telescopes)
- [ ] port `adv_tra_vert_impl` (f3 area rule, owned loop, no `zbar_n`, 2-layer guard)
- [ ] replace the driver error stop with the FESOM2 sequence; update the module header
- [ ] confirm `tools/run_pressuredump_pi.sh` still runs (it forces `use_wsplit=.true.`
  through this path)
- [ ] run `test_wimpl_tra` np 1/2 + full `ctest` — must pass before Task 4

### Task 4: Drivers, diagnostics, gate

**Files:**
- Modify: `src/drivers/fesom_conserve.F90`, `src/drivers/fesom_lifecycle_native_mr.F90`
- Modify: `tools/run_conserve_pi.sh`, `test/CMakeLists.txt`

- [ ] env hooks (both drivers): `FESOM3_WSPLIT` (presence → `use_wsplit`),
  `FESOM3_WSPLIT_MINCFL`, `FESOM3_WSPLIT_MAXCFL` (values; defaults 0.5 / 1.0), validated
  with `wsplit_check_params` (error stop); banner with both numbers
- [ ] `fesom_conserve`: last-step split statistics + `FESOM3_WSPLIT_EXPECT_SPLIT=1` error
  stop on zero split faces
- [ ] measure `max CFL_z` of the 20-step pi conserve run (cold start from rest: expected
  far below 0.5) and choose `FESOM3_WSPLIT_MAXCFL` for the gate config so that a
  substantial number of faces split, some with `f ≥ 0.5`; record the measured counts here
  (➕ fill in: max CFL_z = …, chosen maxcfl = …, faces f>0 = …, f≥0.5 = …)
- [ ] gate configs: `wsplit FESOM3_WSPLIT=1 FESOM3_WSPLIT_MAXCFL=<chosen>
  FESOM3_WSPLIT_EXPECT_SPLIT=1`, `momadv-vinv-wsplit` (same + `FESOM3_MOMADV_OPT=1`), an
  np=8 block for `wsplit`; ctest `fesom_conserve_zstar_wsplit_np{1,2}` and
  `fesom_conserve_zstar_vinv_wsplit_np{1,2}` (the halo path of `w_e/w_i` is read by the
  next step's momentum advection — np ≥ 2 required)
- [ ] run the full gate — GATE OK required before Task 5

### Task 5: Verify acceptance criteria

- [ ] every requirement in Overview implemented; `use_wsplit=.false.` path bit-identical
  (suite + gate results unchanged)
- [ ] full `ctest` and full gate green at np 1/2/8
- [ ] split statistics of the `wsplit` gate config reported in the commit message

### Task 6: [Final] Update documentation

- [ ] `docs/HANDOFF.md`: `use_wsplit` section (function, parameters, env vars, where the
  implicit parts act, the FCT sequence, the retired pressure byte-gate fields)
- [ ] `docs/LESSONS.md`: one entry (hard switch = degenerate case of the C¹ function;
  the single-face LO explicit/implicit pair is exactly split-invariant, so a smoothness
  test needs operators that differ at first order; the constancy test is the consistency
  proof)
- [ ] stale comments: `src/oce/oce_adv_tra_driver.F90:26-28`, `src/oce/oce_ale.F90:489-496`,
  `src/drivers/fesom_stepdump.F90:147-152`, `fesom_pressuredump.F90:498-501, 563-565`,
  `src/oce/oce_ale_tracer.F90:536-537`
- [ ] move this plan to `docs/plans/completed/`

## Post-Completion

*No checkboxes — informational.*

- **Production**: `job_levante` decides `FESOM3_WSPLIT=1` and `FESOM3_WSPLIT_MINCFL`
  (default 0.5). Use a fresh RUNID; do not switch it on together with other changes.
- **Evaluation**: compare a short run with/without the split on core2 — split-face
  statistics per step, `w` and tracer fields near thin z* surface layers and in
  convective columns, conservation drift.
- **Later options**: NEMO-style interface Courant number / horizontal-Courant coupling as
  an alternative argument of the same function; `cfl_z` and `f` as output means.
